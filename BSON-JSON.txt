JSON->Key value pairs
-->easy to parse, easy to render, most languages

BSON->MongoDB datatype
-->Store and process data
-->Binary encoded value (or) Binary encoded JSON is called BSON
-->It has some extended data types ehich are not supported by JSON (like data,tmestamp,object_ID)

Difference between JSON and BSON

-->JSON based  databases usually return query results which can be effortlessly parsed,having modest or nix transformation
-->straightforwardly by the use of JS

-->In mongoDB,data representation is done in JSON document format,but here JSON is binary-encoded which is BSON.


-->JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. 
-->JSON data structures are often used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing data in files.

-->When JSON data is processed, it typically undergoes transformation, which can involve various operations such as parsing, validation, manipulation, and serialization. 
-->However, the term "modest" or "no transformation" might refer to scenarios where the JSON data is handled without significant alterations. Here's what it might imply:

-->MODEST TRANSFORMATION: 
    In this context, "modest transformation" could indicate that the JSON data undergoes some basic processing or manipulation but without significant changes to its structure or content. 
    This might include operations like parsing the JSON string into a JavaScript object, accessing specific properties, or making minor modifications to the data.

-->NO TRANSFORMATION: 
    "No transformation" would imply that the JSON data remains unchanged throughout the processing pipeline. 
    This could occur when the JSON data is simply transmitted from one system to another without any parsing, validation, or manipulation.
