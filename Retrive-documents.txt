#Multiple ways to read data from collection

1.find()--->finds all the documents in the collection
    db.<collection_name>.find()

2.findOne()--->finds first documents in collection
    db.<collection_name>.findOne()
    
3.By setting query conditions--->returns the document that matches with the condition
    db.<collection_name>find({"key1":"value","key2":"value"})

4.findOneAndReplace({"key1":"value","key2":"value"},{<replacement>})
    //it gets two parameters first one is the data that need to be change and second one is data that need to be replaced.

5.findOneAndDelete({"key1":"value","key2":"value"}) //deletes the document that matches the data.
