DATABASE,DOCUMENT,COLLECTION

DATABASE
--->Database is collection of data.
MongoDB DATABASE
--->Physical container for collections.
--->Database can have any number of collections
--->Each database has its own set of files on the file System
--->A MongoDB server can hosts multiple databases inside it.

COLLECTION
--->collection is a group of MongoDB documents
--->We can relate collection as tables:
--->but here, collection does not have any schema definition
--->In table we use joins, here in MongoDB we use Aggregations.

DOCUMENT
--->Document in MongoDB is a set of key-value pairs.
--->Every document in MongoDB has a unique value via Key "_id"
--->Documents have flexible and dynamic schema
--->Document schema is user-defined and is not fixed or static
--->documents can hold any data as along as they are valid data types in MongoDB
--->Document within a collection can have different schema or fields.
--->documents within a collection are related data belonging to a particular subject.

RDBMS:
--->Relational Database Management System
--->Tables,columns,rows

Tables:
--->stands for entities (like person,users,courses)

Columns:
--->Fields inside the table (eg.person have firstname,lastname,email,mobile,address)

Rows:
--->Actual datas 

MONOGODB
--->Database,Collection,Documents

Documents:
--->simple Key-value pair data
--->Schema is different for different documents
--->user-defined schema in MongoDB documents (not fixed or static)
--->MongoDB will add a key automatically for each document
    - _id(have 24 characters)
--->Example:
    {
        "_id":<unique_value",
        "firstName":"Barat",
        "lastName":"raj",
        "email":"abc2gmail.com"
    }
    {
        "_id":<unique_value",
        "firstName":"dinesh",
        "lastName":"raj",
        "email":"abc3gmail.com",
        "address":"chennai"
    } //first doc contains no address but second doc contains address so schema is different.

Collections:
--->set of documents
--->can have any number of documents
--->Documents can have any dynamic schema (can be same or different)
--->collections do not enforce any schema 
    (no joins concept,we use aggregation here)

Database:
--->single or more collections together can form a database

Compass APP:
--->It is GUI tool for managing our MongoDB.
